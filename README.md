## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

##### Your Task

For this homework, we will be implementing the cart feature within our very own (Sweets' Store), Candy Cloud.

You have been provided with a static application, that has 2 pages.
A) Catalog-Page
B) Cart-Page

You can click on the logo (Candy Cloud) in the Navbar to access the Catalog-page and the Cart Icon can be used to render the Cart component.

You need to use Redux to create a store such that you can add/remove products into the cart. Remember that you can add multiple products of the same kind as well.

Reflecting to the amount of times you add/delete:
A) The quantity for each item in your Catalog Component should be updated. I have hardcoded it as 2 for now. You are to initialize it to 0 and change it according to the user adding/removing products.

B) The cart should display the Product Title, Quantity, Total Price (Units Purchased x Unit Price) and the total bill which will be the sum of all the Total Price values.

##### WHAT YOU SHOULD NOT DO

You cannot create ANY EXTRA COMPONENTS.
You cannot remove ANY OF THE PROVIDED COMPONENTS.
You cannot change ANY PROPS being passed to any of the components.

##### Goodluck!
